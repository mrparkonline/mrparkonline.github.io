The Boolean data type allow us to implement logic in our code by simplifying statements to be either True or False.
Boolean in Python 3 There are two Boolean data-typed possible values in Python.
True False Usage:
Boolean is a built-in data type much like: integer, floating points, strings and lists. We can set variables with Boolean values We can get them as a result from Comparison, Logical, and Membership operations Certain functions and methods will result in a Boolean value as well Truthy and Falsy Values in Python 3 In programming (Python), certain values can be also True or False in Conditional Situations.</description></item><item><title>Conditional Iteration</title><link>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/while/01conditionaliteration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/while/01conditionaliteration/</guid><description>Conditional Iteration: While Loops Iteration is the act of repeating a mathematical or computational process. Each repeated step in iteration is also called an iteration.
While Loops While loops are our very first iteration statements that we can incorporate into our program. It behaves very similar to an if statement; however, a while loop will repeat its code block when its condition evaluates to True.

For loops don&amp;rsquo;t depend on a conditional statement being True. For loops will repeat a finite amount of time dependent on the size/length of the iterating sequence.
# For Loop Format for __iterating_variable__ in __iterating__sequence__: your code here # end of for loop A for loop is started by using the keyword: for __iterating_variable__ is a label that you create to represent the individual items in the sequence No matter the iterating variable, the code within the for loop will execute The code within the for loop executes repeatedly until the iterating variable runs out of items to represent from the sequence What is a Sequence?</description></item><item><title>Matrices &amp; List Comprehension</title><link>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/datastruct/matrices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/datastruct/matrices/</guid><description>Matrices in Python 3 What is a Matrix? Mathematically, matrix is a representations of numbers, symbols, or expressions in a 2-Dimensional Array.
In Computer Science, especially with Python, we can start to create a data structure that has values in rows and columns, much like a table, by utilizing a list within a list.

Strings Strings are a data type in Python 3 that represent sequence of alphanumeric characters and special symbols. Strings will be enclosed with either 'single' or &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; quotations marks to denote them as strings. You cannot mix match the quotations.
Examples:
&amp;quot;a&amp;quot; or 'a' &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; or '1' &amp;quot;0010&amp;quot; or '0010' String Characteristics Variables can hold string type values: last_name = &amp;quot;Park&amp;quot; A string value can be empty: string_variable = '' A space is considered a non-empty string Strings are comparable; therefore, you can create boolean expressions when comparing strings 'Hello' == 'hello' evaluates to False because strings are also case-sensitive (also, the ascii value comparisons are different) String Comparison Source: Wikipedia</description></item><item><title>Boolean Operators</title><link>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/conditionals/2booleanoperators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/conditionals/2booleanoperators/</guid><description>Boolean Operators In this lesson, we will be talking about built-in Python operators that will give us a Boolean result.

It may seem like a bad idea to have an infinite loop; however, there are scenarios that may require an infinite loop.
The most common scenario is when a program needs to be on always.

By using range() function along with a for loop, we can start to analyze integer based sequences.
range() function The range() function can take 3 different arguments and it must have atleast 1 argument.
The range() function is a function that generates an iterable sequence of integers in an arithmetic progression.

These two functions that we learn will also be revisited when we do functional programming and lambda functions.
The Map Function The idea of a map function is to apply a function to an iterable data.
Formatting: map(function_name, sequence) -- function_name: any function (built-in or selfmade) that returns a desired value of choice -- sequence: any iterable data type # Example def square(num): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; squares the given num argument &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; return num ** 2 # end of square array = list(range(1,11)) square_array = list(map(square, array)) print(&amp;#39;Original Array:&amp;#39;, array) print(&amp;#39;Array Squared:&amp;#39;, square_array) Original Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Array Squared: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] One thing to note about the map function is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t return a specific data type, but rather, an python iterable data.</description></item><item><title>Print Function</title><link>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/basics/2printfunction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://mrparkonline.github.io/courses/basics/2printfunction/</guid><description>Outputing Information w/ Python print() an output function Anytime we need to output data/information on to the interpreter, we use the print() function.

$fib(n)= fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)$
$fib(0) = 0$

Set is a mathematical way to describe collection of different unique objects.
By following the operations and characteristics of the mathematical set, we can utilizie such data structure in our Python code.

Overall Idea:
- (L→ List, i→ index, i starts at 1) - Look at L[i] and L[i-1] if they are not sorted, swap locations - Repeat as you increase i and until no swap occurs Bubble Sort Demonstration:

Bubble Sort Algorithm Definition:
